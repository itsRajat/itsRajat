### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I am Rajat Kaushik, a 22-year old Software Developer & Graphic Designer from India.

I've had a keen interest in building things since I was a kid; from breaking & modifying RC cars, running my own multiplayer game servers (mostly in SA:MP) to developing large-scale applications, I've always had passion for translating complex problems into engaging experiences. I'm in the final year of my CompSci (CSE) Degree at Chandigarh University and currently looking for a full-time opportunity at a product-based company to grow, learn & contribute at.

Some of the technologies I've been learning/using recently -
Java | JavaScript (ES6+) | Photoshop | Flutter/Dart | React | HTML & CSS | WordPress | XenForo

When I'm not doing all of that, I can be found reading books (Neuroscience/Self-Improvement/Psychology stuff mostly), listening to podcasts, working out, playing COD or just experimenting with a new recipe in my kitchen (or cleaning the mess afterwards before my mom finds out :S).

You can view my portfolio, resume & more at https://www.rajatk.tech/

Have a splendid day!

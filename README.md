I am Rajat Kaushik, a 25-year old Frontend Engineer from India.

I've had a keen interest in building things since I was a kid; from breaking & modifying RC cars, running my own multiplayer game servers (mostly in SA:MP) to developing large-scale applications, I've always had passion for translating complex problems into engaging experiences. I'm currently the Frontend Lead at CosmicJS and have previously worked at Unacademy (Graphy) where I lead the Frontend of some projects.

Fun fact:
```javascript
// Which came first: the chicken or the egg?

console.log(["🥚", "🐣", "🐥", "🐔"].sort())
```
Output: ["🐔", "🐣", "🐥", "🥚"];
